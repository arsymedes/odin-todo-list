/**
 * An IndexedDB-backed instance of Persistence. Data is stored persistently
 * across sessions.
 *
 * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence
 * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and
 * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is
 * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke
 * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.
 *
 * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK
 * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick
 * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is
 * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary
 * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to
 * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to
 * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as
 * primary.
 *
 * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only
 * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of
 * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence
 * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see
 * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from
 * persistence.
 *
 * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary
 * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as
 * the addition of new mutations and query targets.
 *
 * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary
 * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent
 * operations will automatically fail.
 *
 * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the
 * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make
 * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary
 * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload
 * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the
 * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a "zombiedClient" entry in
 * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and
 * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.
 *
 * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no
 * longer optional.

/**
 * The Firestore query engine.
 *
 * Firestore queries can be executed in three modes. The Query Engine determines
 * what mode to use based on what data is persisted. The mode only determines
 * the runtime complexity of the query - the result set is equivalent across all
 * implementations.
 *
 * The Query engine will use indexed-based execution if a user has configured
 * any index that can be used to execute query (via `setIndexConfiguration()`).
 * Otherwise, the engine will try to optimize the query by re-using a previously
 * persisted query result. If that is not possible, the query will be executed
 * via a full collection scan.
 *
 * Index-based execution is the default when available. The query engine
 * supports partial indexed execution and merges the result from the index
 * lookup with documents that have not yet been indexed. The index evaluation
 * matches the backend's format and as such, the SDK can use indexing for all
 * queries that the backend supports.
 *
 * If no index exists, the query engine tries to take advantage of the target
 * document mapping in the TargetCache. These mappings exists for all queries
 * that have been synced with the backend at least once and allow the query
 * engine to only read documents that previously matched a query plus any
 * documents that were edited after the query was last listened to.
 *
 * There are some cases when this optimization is not guaranteed to produce
 * the same results as full collection scans. In these cases, query
 * processing falls back to full scans. These cases are:
 *
 * - Limit queries where a document that matched the query previously no longer
 *   matches the query.
 *
 * - Limit queries where a document edit may cause the document to sort below
 *   another document that is in the local cache.
 *
 * - Queries that have never been CURRENT or free of limbo documents.

/**
 * A PersistentStream is an abstract base class that represents a streaming RPC
 * to the Firestore backend. It's built on top of the connections own support
 * for streaming RPCs, and adds several critical features for our clients:
 *
 *   - Exponential backoff on failure
 *   - Authentication via CredentialsProvider
 *   - Dispatching all callbacks into the shared worker queue
 *   - Closing idle streams after 60 seconds of inactivity
 *
 * Subclasses of PersistentStream implement serialization of models to and
 * from the JSON representation of the protocol buffers for a specific
 * streaming RPC.
 *
 * ## Starting and Stopping
 *
 * Streaming RPCs are stateful and need to be start()ed before messages can
 * be sent and received. The PersistentStream will call the onOpen() function
 * of the listener once the stream is ready to accept requests.
 *
 * Should a start() fail, PersistentStream will call the registered onClose()
 * listener with a FirestoreError indicating what went wrong.
 *
 * A PersistentStream can be started and stopped repeatedly.
 *
 * Generic types:
 *  SendType: The type of the outgoing message of the underlying
 *    connection stream
 *  ReceiveType: The type of the incoming message of the underlying
 *    connection stream
 *  ListenerType: The type of the listener that will be used for callbacks

 * Letters marked by ! are non-standard, but implemented by date-fns:
 * - `o` modifies the previous token to turn it into an ordinal (see `format` docs)
 * - `i` is ISO day of week. For `i` and `ii` is returns numeric ISO week days,
 *   i.e. 7 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.
 * - `I` is ISO week of year, as opposed to `w` which is local week of year.
 * - `R` is ISO week-numbering year, as opposed to `Y` which is local week-numbering year.
 *   `R` is supposed to be used in conjunction with `I` and `i`
 *   for universal ISO week-numbering date, whereas
 *   `Y` is supposed to be used in conjunction with `w` and `e`
 *   for week-numbering date specific to the locale.
 * - `P` is long localized date format
 * - `p` is long localized time format

 * Notes:
 * 1. "Formatting" units (e.g. formatting quarter) in the default en-US locale
 *    are the same as "stand-alone" units, but are different in some languages.
 *    "Formatting" units are declined according to the rules of the language
 *    in the context of a date. "Stand-alone" units are always nominative singular:
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`
 *
 * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by
 *    the single quote characters (see below).
 *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table (e.g. `EEEEEEEEEEE`)
 *    the output will be the same as default pattern for this unit, usually
 *    the longest one (in case of ISO weekdays, `EEEE`). Default patterns for units
 *    are marked with "2" in the last column of the table.
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMM') //=> 'Nov'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMM') //=> 'November'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMM') //=> 'N'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMM') //=> 'November'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMMM') //=> 'November'`
 *
 * 3. Some patterns could be unlimited length (such as `yyyyyyyy`).
 *    The output will be padded with zeros to match the length of the pattern.
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'yyyyyyyy') //=> '00002017'`
 *
 * 4. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.
 *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.
 *
 * 5. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:
 *
 *    | Year | `y` | `u` |
 *    |------|-----|-----|
 *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |
 *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |
 *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |
 *
 *    Also `yy` always returns the last two digits of a year,
 *    while `uu` pads single digit years to 2 characters and returns other years unchanged:
 *
 *    | Year | `yy` | `uu` |
 *    |------|------|------|
 *    | 1    |   01 |   01 |
 *    | 14   |   14 |   14 |
 *    | 376  |   76 |  376 |
 *    | 1453 |   53 | 1453 |
 *
 *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),
 *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`
 *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [getISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getISOWeekYear}
 *    and [getWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeekYear}).
 *
 * 6. Specific non-location timezones are currently unavailable in `date-fns`,
 *    so right now these tokens fall back to GMT timezones.
 *
 * 7. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:
 *    - `i`: ISO day of week
 *    - `I`: ISO week of year
 *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year
 *    - `t`: seconds timestamp
 *    - `T`: milliseconds timestamp
 *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier
 *    - `P`: long localized date
 *    - `p`: long localized time
 *
 * 8. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.
 *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr
 *
 * 9. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are often confused with days of the month.
 *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr
 *
 * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:
 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).
 *
 * - The second argument is now required for the sake of explicitness.
 *
 *   ```javascript
 *   // Before v2.0.0
 *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1))
 *
 *   // v2.0.0 onward
 *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1), "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSxxx")
 *   ```
 *
 * - New format string API for `format` function
 *   which is based on [Unicode Technical Standard #35](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).
 *   See [this post](https://blog.date-fns.org/post/unicode-tokens-in-date-fns-v2-sreatyki91jg) for more details.
 *
 * - Characters are now escaped using single quote symbols (`'`) instead of square brackets.
 *
 * @param {Date|Number} date - the original date
 * @param {String} format - the string of tokens
 * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.
 * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object. See [Locale]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Locale}
 * @param {0|1|2|3|4|5|6} [options.weekStartsOn=0] - the index of the first day of the week (0 - Sunday)
 * @param {Number} [options.firstWeekContainsDate=1] - the day of January, which is
 * @param {Boolean} [options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens=false] - if true, allows usage of the week-numbering year tokens `YY` and `YYYY`;
 *   see: https://git.io/fxCyr
 * @param {Boolean} [options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens=false] - if true, allows usage of the day of year tokens `D` and `DD`;

 *
 * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).

 * - Now `isValid` doesn't throw an exception
 *   if the first argument is not an instance of Date.
 *   Instead, argument is converted beforehand using `toDate`.
 *
 *   Examples:
 *
 *   | `isValid` argument        | Before v2.0.0 | v2.0.0 onward |
 *   |---------------------------|---------------|---------------|
 *   | `new Date()`              | `true`        | `true`        |
 *   | `new Date('2016-01-01')`  | `true`        | `true`        |
 *   | `new Date('')`            | `false`       | `false`       |
 *   | `new Date(1488370835081)` | `true`        | `true`        |
 *   | `new Date(NaN)`           | `false`       | `false`       |
 *   | `'2016-01-01'`            | `TypeError`   | `false`       |
 *   | `''`                      | `TypeError`   | `false`       |
 *   | `1488370835081`           | `TypeError`   | `true`        |
 *   | `NaN`                     | `TypeError`   | `false`       |
 *
 *   We introduce this change to make *date-fns* consistent with ECMAScript behavior
 *   that try to coerce arguments to the expected type
 *   (which is also the case with other *date-fns* functions).
 *
 * @param {*} date - the date to check
